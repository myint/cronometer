<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<h4>Cut, Copy, and Paste Shortcuts</h4>

Standard keyboard shortcuts for Cut, Copy and Paste will work on selected
items in your daily listing. For example, you can easily copy a selection of 
foods and paste them into a different day. You can also paste the results 
into a text editor.

<h4>Keyboard accelerators for food entry</h4>

There are also many ways to accelerate through data entry with the keyboard. 
Control-E (Command-E on Max OS X) will bring up the food search dialog. 
<p>
If the top ranked search result is what you're looking 
for, hitting enter will auto-select it. When you select a food, the 
keyboard focus automatically transfers to the amount field. Hitting enter 
after typing an amount will automatically add the food. Tab will select 
the Measure menu and you can use the arrow keys to page through them. You 
can actually enter foods without ever touching the mouse.
