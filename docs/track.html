<h2>Daily Summary</h2>

<h3>Entering Daily Consumption</h3>
Select the date for which you want to enter your consumption.
Click on the "Add Serving" icon&nbsp;
<img src="addserving.png" width="92" height="19" title="" alt="" class="va-middle">&nbsp;
to open a dialog box with the food database.</p>
<br><br>
<div align="center">

</div> 
<p>
Search the data base for the foods that you consume, select by clicking the appropriate entry,
and then click the "Add" button.  For example, suppose that you ate a McDonald's Big Mac for lunch.
When you search for "mcdonald's", there will be a list of McDonald's products.  Click once on 
"McDONALD'S, BIG MAC" (Don't double click because that will bring the food editing panel).
Click on the portion size pull-down menu which will display "g" (gram) or "item".  Select "item", 
and then click the "Add" button.  The food will be added to the right side of the screen
for the corresponding day.</p>

<p>
The distribution of macronutrients relative to the targets is immediately displayed in the
colorful bars and the pie-chart of the summary.   The numbers in parentheses give you the
percentages of your daily targets.  You can then say: "Wow! 51% of the calories of a Big Mac
come from fat!!!" (the red part of the circle). 
Hopefully, you can make better choices for the 
rest of the day.  CRON-o-meter will help to keep you on track.</p>

<p>
Notice that the percentages on the bar chart for Protein, Carbohydrates, and Lipids
are the percentages of the gram amounts, whereas the pie-chart represents the percentages
of the total calories for each of these macronutrients.
The Calories from alcohol, which contains approximately 7 Calories per gram, are represented as a 
lime-green sector in the pie-chart, and included in the total calories. There is no bar graph for 
alcohol since there is no minimum requirement. </p>

<h4>Setting Nutritional Targets</h4>
The default nutritional values provided by CRON-o-meter are based on the official 
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) set by the USDA.  You can change these values
to implement any diet.  Using the tabs, navigate to any
particular nutrient, double click on the value that you want to modify, and enter
a new value using the keyboard.
