<h1 align="center">PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</h1>
This tool helps you track your nutrition. Please understand that
the data displayed in this software should always be treated as
a rough estimate, not the gospel truth.  The data itself may contain
errors or be incomplete. The USDA food database, for instance,
contains average values for most foods. Local soil and growing 
conditions can deviate largely from the average values. Some
nutrients are underrepresented in the database because not every
food item has undergone comprehensive analysis. 
Furthermore, this software may contain unknown bugs that affect
the reported values. Thus it is essential that you do not use this 
program to make life-critical decisions.

<h2>You get what you pay for</h2>
This software is provided free-of-charge, and is the result of countless
hours of work by the developers. We continue to work on this software and
support it at our own leisure. However, if you have an important 'must-have'
feature, we will accept bribes. 

<h2>Help Wanted</h2>
This software is made by an all-volunteer effort. If you want to chip in and
lend a hand there are lots of things you can do to improve the program. Besides
programmers, we could use:
<ul>
 <li>Technical writing skills to make a user-friendly help manual
 <li>Custom art work for icons and aesthetics
 <li>Scientific accuracy -- help find errors, bugs, or improve the nutritional analysis
</ul>
If you wish to contribute, contact aaron@spaz.ca.
