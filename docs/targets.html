<h2>Setting Nutritional Targets</h2> 

    <p> When you first run CRON-o-Meter you will be asked to set your nutritional
     targets for the first time. You can always come back and change these later.
     You can either have the program set default  values for your body-type, or
     manually set them to custom values.</p>
    
     <p> Set your nutritional targets for tracking within the program.
      Every nutrient has a target minimum and maximum. The 
      minimum should be set to the minimum amount you want to consume daily.
      The maximum should be set to an amount you never want to exceed. For instance,
      the toxicity levels of that nutrient should never be exceeded. As you approach a 
      maximum target, the progress bars will go bright red to warn you of the danger.</p>
      
      <p>Clicking 'Set to Dietary Reference Intakes' will set all the targets 
      to values configured for your weight, height, gender, age, and activity level. 
      These values are based on the DRIs published by USDA.  Please note that 
      DRIs are not specified for all nutrients, and so many values will remain unchanged.
      You may also edit the targets directly in the table to the right 
      choosing customized values for your tracking. </p>
       
<p>The default nutritional values provided by CRON-o-meter are based on the official 
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) set by the USDA.  You can change these values
to implement any diet.  Using the tabs, navigate to any
particular nutrient, double click on the value that you want to modify, and enter
a new value using the keyboard.  </p>

<p>To ignore certain nutrients you may not be interested in, toggle off the tracking checkbox
for that nutrient to hide it within the software. Some nutrients are not tracked by default.
Some values have little to no data available in the nutrition database, and so a user must
understand these limitations before interpreting tracking data for these nutrients.</p>
